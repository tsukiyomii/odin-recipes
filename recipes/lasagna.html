        My boss brought this soup to the office one fine day and I was hooked on it from the first taste. It is a snap to make and the flavors are mild, yet very distinct. My kids loved it the first time I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste. It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.    </p>
    <h3>ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart chicken broth </li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 head cauliflower, finely chopped</li>
        <li>head broccoli, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, combine chicken broth, onion, cauliflower, and broccoli. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Continue to simmer until vegetables are tender. Season with curry powder, chicken bouillon, salt, and pepper. </li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine flour and 1/2 cup of the milk. Whisk briskly until there are no lumps. Add mixture to soup, stirring continuously as soup thickens. Stir in Cheddar cheese until completely melted. </li>
